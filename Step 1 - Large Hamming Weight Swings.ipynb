    "**SUMMARY:** *In the previous lab, you saw that a microcontroller's power consumption changes based on what it's doing. In the case of a simple password check, this allowed us to see how many characters of the password we had correct, eventually resulting in the password being broken.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*That attack was based on different code execution paths showing up differently in power traces. In this next set of labs, we'll posit that, not only does different instructions affect power consumption, the data being manipulated in the microcontroller also affects power consumption.*\n",

    "**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a power measurement to 'validate' a possible device model.\n",
    "* Detecting the value of a single bit using power measurement.\n",

For this purpose, the target is currently running AES, and it encrypted the text we sent it. If we're correct in our assumption, we should see a measurable difference between power traces with a high Hamming weight and a low one.\n",
